What is Madlib???

     Mad Libs is a word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud.

How we are going to implement it???

    1====> WE WILL BE USING STRING CONATENATION
    2====> STRING FORMATTING USING F FORMAT
    EXAMPLE :
         name=input('Enter the name:')
         print(f'Good morning {name}')
Note: 
    1) Many string formatting methods are present,for example,format() can also be used.
    2) \ is used to indicate that the string still continue and it doesnt get's ended here
