# PYTHON PROJECTS

This repository contains three Python projects that I worked on. Each project is designed to showcase my skills in different areas of programming. Here's a brief overview of each project:

1. **Mad Lib**: A fun game that prompts the user to enter words of a certain type (e.g. noun, verb, adjective) and then generates a story using those words.Contributions are welcome!

2. **Guessing Game**: A simple game that prompts the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and upto input given from user . The game provides hints to help the user guess the correct number. Contributions are welcome!

3. **Rock Paper Scissors**: A classic game that prompts the user to choose either rock, paper, or scissors and then plays against the computer.Contributions are welcome!

Please feel free to explore each project and provide feedback. Thank you for visiting!

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any further assistance.
